I do not thing that "vetor" will work for our case as we need two values as an atomic value in our case. Ex: coordinate (1,1) is an atomic value and cannot be further broken down, but in the "vector" implementation in our project, each value is taken as a single atomic value.

This is what I understood.
Open to comments.
